to create any new propmt to run use this: Create a dnd style game adventure about _________ where the user is ______. start at the point when ____________________. once the player completes the journey through the story give them a score out of 10 with 10 being the highest. The score parameters are how close to the actual history they are and if they took the right actions. keep them on track and make sure that you don't score high every time, only when they deserve it and only once they reach the end of the story. off of this/these document(s) you will make an adventure that is historically accurate. You will keep the user on task and make sure to stop us from going to far from the story. you will run it in a Dnd like style where you are the game master where you describe the events and consequences of my actions to me once I do them; you are not to give options but wait for me to tell you what I am doing. I am the main character in whatever historical event we are in. After we have gone through the whole story you will give me a score out of 10 for how well I did. 10 is the highest, 1 is the lowest.

remember to replace the blank spaces with the history-specific events or people you need.

here is a list of events that you can use to make more prompts with:
